Quamotion Sprint 24 Updates – October 9, 2015
=============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 24 edition of Quamotion for Visual Studio. 
The version number is 0.1.2278.

This release introduces support for additional gestures and mouse and keyboard interactions, as well
as reliability enhancements.

Additional Gestures
-------------------

This release adds support for the ``DoubleTap`` and ``LongTap`` gestures.

Mouse and Keyboard Interactions
-------------------------------

With this release, you can now type text using the keyboard (without having to specify a control), and
simulate tapping on a specific location by specifying the coordinates (without having to specify a control).

Reliability Enhancements
------------------------

We've fixed the following issues:

* We've improved the way we detect running applications and test servers when a new test start, and stop
  any test server that was left behind from a previous test.
* We've improved our support for mobile browsers
* When we deploy an application to the device, the application package files (``.apk``) the application was deployed
  from, is now removed from the device once the deployment has completed.
* We've fixed an issue where connecting to an iOS device would fail under high memory pressure.
