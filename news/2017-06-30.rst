Quamotion Sprint 69 Updates – June 30, 2017
===========================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 65 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is .

In this release, we've added support for fetching network statistics on Android devices,
improved the Spy experience, and improved the stability and reliability of the Quamotion WebDriver.

Improved Spy experience
-----------------------

We've worked hard to improve our Spy experience!

We now support generating test scripts in the browser using our recording capability. You can also
manually add test automation steps and import and export your test scenarios.

Fetching network statistics on Android devices
----------------------------------------------

You can now get a detailed network statistics of the network traffic on an Android device, per network
interface.

Stability and reliability enhancements
--------------------------------------

We've fixed:
* An issue where deploying an Android application which contains an application icon
  file without a file extension would fail.
* An issue where deploying an iOS application which contains two folders with the
  `.app` extension would fail.
