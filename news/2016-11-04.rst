Quamotion Sprint 52 Updates – November 4, 2016
==============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 52 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.1.5692.

This release adds better support for various iOS applications, new gestures, and support for
applications which use Google Maps

Improved support for iOS applications
-------------------------------------

- Resigning of iOS applications now consumes less memory
- iOS applications which contain symbolic links are now supported

Support for new gestures
------------------------

In this release, we've added support for the following gestures:

- Dismissing the keyboard
- Scrolling to an item in a view (list)
- Fixes for tapping by (x,y) coordinate.

Support for Google Maps
-----------------------

Android applications which use Google Maps are now supported. Typically, these applications use a Google API key which may need to be updated
when you resign your application. In this release, we've added support for automatically using an updated Google API key.
