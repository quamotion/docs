==========================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 14 edition of Quamotion for Visual Studio. 
The version number is 0.1.1385.

This release brings support for CrossWalk apps and integration with AppVeyor for running
tests on a hosted build server. Additionally, this release brings a lot of usability and stability 
enhancements.

Integration with AppVeyor
-------------------------

With this release, we support running Quamotion tests on AppVeyor build servers. We provide configuration
scripts that take care of installing the Quamotion and Remote TestKit software on the AppVeyor build server.

With our AppVeyor integration, you can now run tests fully unattended in the cloud.

Support CrossWalk apps
----------------------
With this release, we've added support for CrossWalk applications and other Cromium-based frameworks.
We fully support automating the objects inside CrossWalk applications.

Usability Enhancements
----------------------

* We have added support for Android applications that have different startup activities
  for different types of devices
* When clicking the 'Use this application' button in the Mobile Test Settings editor, you now
  receive a visual indicating that the application transfer operation is in progress.
  This button is now disabled when no application is selected.
* We have added various stability fixes in the device providers and orchestrator code.
