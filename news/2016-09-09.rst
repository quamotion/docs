Quamotion Sprint 48 Updates – September 9, 2016
===============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 48 edition of Quamotion for Visual Studio. 
The version number is 0.1.5507.

This release adds improved documentation and stability and usability enhancements.

In this release, we've worked to update the Quamotion documentation and improved stability and memory
consumption of Quamotion on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Stability and usability enhancements
------------------------------------

This release:
- Adds support for accepting alerts on iOS devices, even if the buttons on the alert are not only _OK_ or _Cancel_ .
- Adds a better error message when an Android device could not be found (possibly because it disconnected from adb).
- Adds a more descriptive error message when an element could not be found
