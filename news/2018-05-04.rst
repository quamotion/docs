Quamotion Sprint 90 Updates – May 4, 2018
=========================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 90 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.90.19.

In this release, we've fixed issues with starting applications and settings on iOS devices.

Reliability and stability improvements
--------------------------------------

We've:

- Fixed an issue where the `Install-App` command would fail on iOS devices
- Made the timeout for starting a device session on iOS and rebooting a device configurable. You can set the values of the `xcuiTestPlanTimeout`, `deviceConnectTimeout` and `deviceDisconnectTimeout`
  settings in the `appsettings.json` file. The timeout values are expressed in seconds.
