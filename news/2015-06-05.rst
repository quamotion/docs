Quamotion Sprint 15 Updates – June 5, 2015
==========================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 15 edition of Quamotion for Visual Studio. 
The version number is 0.1.1448.

This release brings support for recording of scripts on native Android applications, 
and supports testing applications with different layouts on different devices.
Additionally, this release brings a lot of usability and stability enhancements.

Recording of scripts on native Android applications
---------------------------------------------------

This release brings support for recording of scripts on native Android apps. 
You can now start the Coded UI Test Builder and hit the Record button. Once you've done this,
all actions you run on the mobile device - be it a physical device or an emulator - will be recorded
and a script that allows you to replay these actions will be automatically generated.

Support for applications with different layouts on different devices
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain applications have different launch activities on devices with different form factors -
such as phones and tables.

With this release, when starting your app on the device, we detect the form factor of the device
and launch the correct activity.

Usability Enhancements
----------------------
* We now properly detect devices that are connected to your PC, but for which the ADB connection
  has not yet been authorized.

* We've fixed a bug where you could not launch an app on a real, physical Android device connected
  to your PC over USB.
