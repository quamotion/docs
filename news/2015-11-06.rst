Quamotion Sprint 26 Updates – November 6, 2015
==============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 26 edition of Quamotion for Visual Studio. 
The version number is 0.1.2577.

This release includes support for the Back key on Android and iOS, and stability and usability
enhancements accross the board.

Back key
--------

You can now navigate to the previous activity by calling the ``Device.Back()`` method in your Mobile
Coded UI or NUnit test scripts.

Stability and usability enhancements
------------------------------------

We've made various improvements in the stability and usability of our product:

* We've reviewed and improved many of the time outs that are present in the product. As a general
  rule of thumb, we've improved the time outs to so the code fails fast - if the code detects an
  incorrect configuration (for example, the device is not responding to certain messages), 
  it will attempt to either fix the configuration or fail, but it will not wait for a long period
  of time for the situation to correct itself.
* We've reviewed and improved certain log messages that are generated when tests are running.
* We've fixed an issue where opening the Coded UI Test Builder two times in a row would fail
  for iOS devices
