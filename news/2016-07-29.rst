Improved support for hybrid applications on iOS devices
-------------------------------------------------------

In this release, we've improved or support for hybrid applications on iOS devices. Quamotion now uses
the Safari Web Inspector to automate hybrid applications on iOS devices.

This fixes a crash which occurs when clicking on an element in a web view embedded in a native page,
when that element triggers a transition to another window (causing the web view to be closed) #44

As a result, Quamotion now requires you to enable the Safari Web Inspector on iOS devices.
You can enable Safari Web Inspector by taking these steps:

* Open `Settings`
* Tap `Safari`
* Tap `Advanced`
* Make sure the `Web Inspector` option is enabled.
