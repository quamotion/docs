Quamotion Sprint 60 Updates – February 24, 2017
===============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 60 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.1.6291.0.

We've improved our support for iOS and Android application packages (`.ipa` and `.apk` files).
We've also made usability and stability enhancements.

iOS and Android application packages
------------------------------------

* The Quamotion WebDriver now supports Android applications which have been obfuscated using DexGuard and similar tools.
* The Quamotion WebDriver now supports iOS applications which contain two code directories and which use SHA256 hashes.

Usability and stability enhancements
------------------------------------

We've made stability enhancements which make it easier to work with Quamotion:

* We've fixed an issue where starting two iOS sessions in parallel would fail.
* The Linux and macOS builds now include the `wdclient.psm1` PowerShell module by default.
* The Linux and macOS builds are smaller in size.
