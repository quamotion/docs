Quamotion Sprint 98 Updates – August 24, 2018
=============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 97 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.98.60.

In this release, we've improved support for the most recent version of iOS 12,
and added better support for recording device screens via FFmpeg.

iOS 12 Support
--------------

We've added support for the Beta 8 version of iOS 12.

Improved screen recording van FFmpeg
------------------------------------

You can use FFmpeg to record a video of the display of your iOS or Android device using the
screenshotFeed endpoint at `/wd/hub/quamotion/device/{deviceId}/screenshotFeed`. This is a MJPEG-
stream, which FFmpeg can record.

The MJPEG stream uses JPEG encoding. In certain scenarios, this requires the WebDriver to re-encode
a screenshot in JPEG, and FFmpeg to then decode that screenshot again.

To work around this problem, we've added a new VNC endpoint which creates a VNC feed using the
"VMware-encoding". This feed uses raw framebuffers and incremental updates, and may perform better.

You can use this endpoint at `/wd/hub/vncVideo`.
