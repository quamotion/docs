Quamotion Sprint 19 Updates – August 3, 2015
============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 19 edition of Quamotion for Visual Studio. 
The version number is 0.1.1575.

With this release we’ve:

* Added support for running tests on `Manymo <http://manymo.com>`_ cloud-based emulators
* Added support for running Coded UI tests using the Xamarin.UITest Framework
* Improved the usability and stability of Quamotion for Visual Studio.

Run tests on Manymo cloud-based emulators
-----------------------------------------

Manymo offers cloud-based Android emulators. We now support running tests on Manymo emulators. For Quamotion tests to run on Manymo emulators, you must follow the steps described in the 
`Making your in-browser emulator as a local emulator on your system <https://www.manymo.com/pages/documentation/manymo-command-line-tool>`_ document. 

Run Coded UI tests using the ``Xamarin.UITest`` Framework
---------------------------------------------------------

Starting with our Sprint 19 release, you can now run Coded UI Tests on mobile devices using the ``Xamarin.UITest`` Framework. To use the ``Xamarin.UITest`` Framework, please specify so in the ``Settings.MobileTestSettings`` file.

Usability and stability
-----------------------

* We’ve fixed an issue where applications would not launch correctly on iOS 8 devices
* We’ve fixed an issue where the Device Display would not close correctly
