In this release, we've improved the stability of the WebDriver.

Reliability and stability improvements
--------------------------------------

We've:

- Upgraded the agent for Full Device Automation on iOS, bringing additional stability and performance enhancements
- Added a `Wait-Device` command in PowerShell, which allows you to block execution of a script until a device is available
- Removed a couple of old dependencies from the WebDriver, reducing the overall package size
