Quamotion Sprint 75 Updates – September 22, 2017
=================================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 75 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.75.25.1049.

In this release, we've added support for remotely controlling iOS devices, as well as imporoved support for web applications.

Remotely controlling iOS devices
--------------------------------

In this release, we're announcing support for remote control of iOS devices. Using the Quamotion WebDriver, you can now
control any iOS device that is connected to your PC using a browser and mouse.

This enables many scenarios, such as setting up a private cloud in which devices are connected to a secure server and which
are accessed remotely. In addition to Quamotion's test automation capabilities, this also enables manual testing of Android
devices.

Improved support for Web Applications
-------------------------------------

We've improved our support for testing Web and Hybrid applications in this release.

Stability and reliability enhancements
--------------------------------------

We've added:

- A `Get-DeviceSessions` command to our PowerShell bindings, which list all sessions currently running on a device.
