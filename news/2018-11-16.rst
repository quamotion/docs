Quamotion Sprint 104 Updates – November 23, 2018
================================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 104 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.104.64.

In this release, we've improved the stability and reliability of the WebDriver.

Stability and reliability improvements
--------------------------------------

We've:
- Fixed an issue where the WebDriver would crash, when you stop the WebDriver
  but a remote screen session is still active.
- Fixed an issue where starting an application on Android may fail, if that
  application has an embedded copy of a popular HTTP server.
- Fixed an issue where certain requests may fail if your PC is using a proxy
  server.
- Fixed an issue where the last known screenshot of any device would be saved
  to the trace folder.

PowerShell improvements
-----------------------

We've:
- Added a `DoubleClick-Element` function to our PowerShell client.
- Added a `Get-AppVersion` function to our PowerShell client, which allows you
  to identify which version of an application is installed on your device.
- The `Start-App` command is now supported on Android.
