Quamotion Sprint 72 Updates – August 11, 2017
=============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 72 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.72.43.18706.

In this release, we've added support for additional UI control properties, custom spy templates and improved the stability and reliability of the Quamotion WebDriver.

Support for additional UI control properties
--------------------------------------------

The Quamotion WebDriver now:
* Shows properties for custom classes
* Shows Protocol properties
* Shows the `AccessibilityIdentifier`

Support for custom Spy templates
--------------------------------

The Quamotion Spy allows you to create scripts for pre-defined actions, such as tapping on a button or typing text.
With this release, you can now add templates for custom actions.

Stability and reliability enhancements
--------------------------------------

We've fixed:

* An issue where the WebDriver would not show the source of very large applications.
* An issue where starting a new session may fail, if you upload different versions of the same Android application which have the same application ID and the same version number.
* An issue where a license warning was displayed even after uploading a valid license.
