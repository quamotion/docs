===============================================

We’re happy to announce the release of the Sprint 74 edition of Quamotion. 
The version number is 0.74.31.4152.

In this release, we've added support for remotely controlling Android devices, as well as Android 8 devices and iOS 11.

Remotely controlling Android devices
------------------------------------

In this release, we're announcing support for remote control of Android devices. Using the Quamotion WebDriver, you can now
control any Android device that is connected to your PC using a browser, mouse and keyboard.

This enables many scenarios, such as setting up a private cloud in which devices are connected to a secure server and which
are accessed remotely. In addition to Quamotion's test automation capabilities, this also enables manual testing of Android
devices.

iOS 11
------

We've added support for running tests on devices which are running iOS 11.

Android 8
---------

We've added support for running tests on devies which are running Android 8.

Stability and reliability enhancements
--------------------------------------

We've fixed:

* An issue with the PowerShell `Flick-Coordinate` command.
* Minor fixes in the Spy user interface.
