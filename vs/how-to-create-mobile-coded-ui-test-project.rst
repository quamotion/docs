How To: Create a Mobile Coded UI Test Project
---------------------------------------------

If you use Quamotion together with Visual Studio Premium or Ultimate, you can create a Mobile Coded UI Test.
You can use a Mobile Coded UI Test to verify whether the user interface of a mobile application, such as an Android or iOS application,
functions correctly.

The Mobile Coded UI Test performs actions, such as tapping on a control or typing text, and verifies that the correct controls are displayed
with the correct values.

For more information about which platforms are supported by Mobile Coded UI Tests, see `Supported Platforms <mobile-coded-ui-supported-platforms>`_.

A Mobile Coded UI Test Project contains a set of Mobile Coded UI tests.
