Introducing Quamotion
=====================

Quamotion is a test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps. It automates iOS and Android apps on real devices (iOS, Android),
simulators (iOS) and emulators (Android), using the WebDriver protocol.

How it works
""""""""""""

Quamotion makes automated testing easy. We let you focus on testing your app, while we take care of the heavy lifting required to automate it.
We don't require you to include a SDK or recompile your app; nor do you have to jailbreak your device.
You know best how to do your job, so we let you use your favourite test practices, frameworks and tools.

Use the tools you're familiar with
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Quamotion allows you to use any language and any test framework to automate your mobile app. You can write tests using your favourite testing tools,
and we expose the WebDriver API which allows you to use interact with your app from any programming language.

Requirements
""""""""""""

Quamotion works on:

* Windows 7 (64-bit) and above
* Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit) and above
* OS X 16.04 (64-bit) and above

and allows you to test:

* iOS 8 and above (`97+% of all iOS devices <https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/>`_)
* Android 4.1 and above (`96+% of all Android devices <https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html>`_)

You don't need to install any platform-specific tools such as Xcode or the Android SDK. You can test iOS devices using a Windows or Linux 
PC, even if you don't have a Mac.
