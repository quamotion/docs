About the Rising Star Award
---------------------------

The Deloitte Technology Fast 50 competition is an annual selection of the 50 fastest growing and innovative
technology companies headquartered in Belgium. Public or private companies who develop a technology related
product or service and who have experienced substantial revenue growth over the last four years can enter the
competition for their chance to be nominated as one of the 50 fastest-growing technology companies in Belgium.

Companies that have been active in the technology sector for less than four years can participate in the special
Rising Star category of the competition. These companies are judged by an independent jury on their turnover
potential and scalability.

Participating in the Rising Star competition can help companies to develop their business by increasing their
visibility and giving them access to the Fast 50â€™s unique network of highly successful executives.
