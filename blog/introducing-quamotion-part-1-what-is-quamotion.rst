Introducing Quamotion – Part 1: What is Quamotion?
==================================================

We’ve launched Quamotion in February 2015 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. 
We have already gotten some very positive feedback regarding the Quamotion software from customers,
partners and the press.

As a result of our launch, we wanted to have a series of blog posts that gives an introduction to Quamotion
and the products Quamotion offers.

When launched Quamotion, we wanted to enable teams to build great mobile applications and help them test 
those applications. When we say Quamotion, we think about the tree capabilities we offer: Quality, Mobile
and Automation.

But first, let’s begin by explaining what exactly it is we are trying to solve.

Testing mobile applications has become increasingly complex. Businesses of all sizes experience tremendous cost
and complexity when they want to test their applications today. 

When a team wants to test a mobile application, they first define the test cases they want to execute. Even a
simple app usually has tens of test cases. Larger apps – such as those of banks or telecom companies – easily
have hundreds of test cases. It’s not always easy to keep track of these test cases; let alone of the results: 
which test cases passed and which ones failed, and does that mean we can release our app or not?

Once a team has a version of an application they need to test, they face the challenge of having to run these test 
cases on multiple different operating systems – such as iOS and Android – and devices. Keeping track of which devices 
they need to test on is difficult. The devices that are in use also frequently change, so teams need to buy new 
devices to be up to date. Finally, getting the right device to the right person is no easy task; and devices are 
often misplaced or lost during testing.

Finally, teams also find that they need to test more often. Agile development typically means a release every couple 
of weeks. If a team has 100 test cases, which they want to execute on 20 devices, and they release every two weeks, 
they have to run over 4 000 different test cases every month. Executing those tests manually is not only time consuming
and expensive, it’s also prone to human error.

Quamotion addresses these challenges through 3 main concepts:

1. Quality Reporting.

   We provide an on line test hub where you can define your mobile test cases, 
   keep track of the results (for my latest release, which tests did I run on which device, and what was the outcome?) 
   and analyze the results in easy to understand reports. This helps you understand the quality of your app and be 
   confident you are ready to release. 

2. Mobile Device Cloud.

   There’s a better way than buying hundreds of mobile devices – phones, tables - just for testing.
   We offer the Remote TestKit cloud, an on line service where we offer you over 300 different phones and tables that
   are stored in secure data centers. You can access these devices remotely and install and use your app on these
   devices. This saves you money – you have to buy less devices – and helps you accelerate your development – no 
   long procurement cycles anymore to get access to the latest device.

3. Mobile Test Automation.

   We allow you to automate the test cases of your mobile apps. Our scripts interact with your
   app just like a real user would; and we help you ensure the app responds to the user correctly. You need to spend 
   less time and money executing tests, and can instead focus on defining the test cases and analyzing the results.

So, with Quamotion, you don’t just get the advantages of test automation, mobile cloud or reporting of your mobile test 
results – you get a complete offering that combines all of those in one single product. And, when we set out to create 
Quamotion, we also made a commitment to make our products easy to use and affordable.

Tune in to the future blog posts in this series to learn more about these capabilities and how they help you address 
the challenges outlined above.
