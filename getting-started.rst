Getting Started
===============

Quamotion is a test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps. It automates iOS and Android apps on real devices (iOS, Android),
simulators (iOS) and emulators (Android), using the WebDriver protocol.

Supported Platforms
"""""""""""""""""""

* iOS 8 and above (`97+% of all iOS devices <https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/>`_)
* Android 4.1 and above (`96+% of all Android devices <https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html>`_)

Why Quamotion?
""""""""""""""

Quamotion makes testing mobile apps easy. We let you focus on testing your app, while we take care of the heavy lifting required to automate it.

* You don't have to recompile your app or modify it in any way: we automate your app using the built-in automation tools of each platform.
* You can write tests in any language or tool that supports `WebDriver <https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html>`_. 
  That includes languages and scripting platforms such as Java, PowerShell and C#.
* You can use any testing framework that supports those languages.

Using the `WebDriver <https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html>`_ protocol is using a single, free and open protocol
for testing that has become a proposed W3C standard. This way, you avoid being locked in to vendor-specific languages.

Requirements
""""""""""""

You'll need either a Mac, Linux or Windows PC:

* Mac OS X 10.11 or higher (64-bit)
* Ubuntu 16.10 or higher (64-bit)
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7 or higher (64-bit), or compatible distribution such as CentOS.
* Windows 7 or higher (64-bit)

That's it! You don't need to install any other tool for you to get started.

If you want to test on iOS devices, you also need to configure a developer profile.
